In 2022, for three months I interned as a frontend developer for Tribe Media, a Kolding based digital agency startup. I was responsible for both design and development of a company course platform. Here i gained experience working with WordPress, Elementor and Crocoblock. I got an understanding for how dynamic websites work and how to create flexible, reuseable components and code.
